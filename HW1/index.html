<p>Greetings! My name is Justin DeBroux. I am a Computer Science student at Georgia State University. I aim to use the development skills I've acquired to help agencies and citizens across the globe.</p>
<p>My main interests currently involve development in gaming and special interests programming for applications such as GPS-related software, User interfacing for financial  </p>
<p>institution webpages, and special needs software applications. This is because I believe there all new software technology created should be in service of the general public.</p>

<p>I have always had an interest in Gaming ever since I was very little. The potential that video games possess to immerse its audience into alternate realities has always
fascinated and as a result has taken up much of my free time over the years. Though it might seem as a bad hobby because of their alluring nature, they also bring together
many different individuals from many different walks of life through the outlet of online multiplayer games. Coupling that fact alongside the joy of creating moments with 
these newfound players can create a more wholesome experience overall and even convince some, like myself, to begin creating games of their own. I have created small indie 
games over the years thanks to online tutorials on Youtube and sites like <a class = "highlight" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. Nowadays, I primarily download and play games through an application provided by an online 
gaming service network known as <a class = "highlight" href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>.</p>
